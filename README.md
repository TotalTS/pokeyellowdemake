# Pokémon Yellow Demake

Hack of: Pokémon Red

This hack imagines how Pokemon Yellow would look like if it was released at the same time of Red and Blue.
This differs from the "Special Pikachu Edition" having just some features from that version and keeping most of the gameplay and visual style of localized Red and Blue.

It builds the following ROMs:

- Pokemon Red (UE) [S][!].gb `sha1: ea9bcae617fdf159b045185467ae58b2e4a48b9a`
- Pokemon Blue (UE) [S][!].gb `sha1: d7037c83e1ae5b39bde3c30787637ba1d4c48ce2`
- REDMONS.GB (debug build)
- dmgapae0.e69.patch `sha1: 0fb5f743696adfe1dbb2e062111f08f9bc5a293a`
- dmgapee0.e68.patch `sha1: ed4be94dc29c64271942c87f2157bca9ca1019c7`

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
Keep in mind that this is an already old version of Pokered.

To patch the ROM, Beat Patcher is recommended. https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/893/
